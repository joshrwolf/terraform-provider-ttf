# Terraform Provider TTF (Terraform Test Framework)

ðŸš¨ **This is a work in progress** ðŸš¨

A terraform provider for authoring and exucting tests using terraform primitives.

## Usage

This provides several resources for authoring and executing tests:

- `ttf_environment`: Define ephemeral environments to execute tests against
- `ttf_feature`: Author features to test
- `ttf_harness_*`: Define reusable test harnesses


```hcl
# Define features to test against environments
resource "ttf_feature" "footure" {
  name        = "footure"
  description = "My great footure"

  setup {
    cmd = "echo 'setup'" # do some feature specific setup
  }

  teardown {
    cmd = "echo 'teardown'" # some feature specific teardown
  }

  assert {
    cmd = "echo 'first assertion'" # run assertions that pass or fail
  }

  assert {
    cmd = "kubectl get po -A" # assertions are environment configuration independent
  }
}

# Define reusable environment test harnesses
resource "ttf_harness_k3s" "simple" {}
resource "ttf_harness_teardown" "simple" { harness = ttf_harness_k3s.simple.id }

# Define testing environments
resource "ttf_environment" "foo" {
  harness = ttf_harness_k3s.simple.id

  test {
    features = [ttf_feature.footure.id]
  }
}

# Retrieve test results as machine readable test reports
output "foo_report" {
  values = ttf_environment.foo.report
}
```
